Cloning github

## Project
https://github.com/users/ravish0007/projects/2

This is made by sticking hacks together, Not very neat at this point.
Goal is to study git on servers, opensource implementations and basic project (custom git shell + user access control + user collaboration (pull-request implementation))

## Interesting pieces
- https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-The-Protocols  (server methods and preventing ssh access + tunneling)
- https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/
- Gitlab's gitlab-shell (ssh), gitaly (rpc), gitlab-workhorse (git+https)
- libgit2 >>> stiching shell scripts
- gitolite (shell for git)
- sourcehut, cgit, gitosis, gitea, pagure
